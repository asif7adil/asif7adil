## 🧬 About Me

I'm a researcher working at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Single-cell Transcriptomics**, and **Spatial Omics**, with a particular focus on **pancreatic cancer**. I specialize in building scalable AI tools and models to better understand tumor microenvironments and predict treatment outcomes.

My background spans:
- Deep learning model development (MLP, TabPFN, attention-based models)
- Spatial and single-cell transcriptomics analysis (Seurat, Scanpy, STUtility, Squidpy)
- Cancer biology interpretation with zero formal background in biology 😄
- Manuscript writing, figure generation, and visual storytelling

## 🧪 Current Projects

- 🧠 **AI-based prediction of stem cell mobilization success** using baseline and post-G-CSF CBC data  
- 🧭 **Lab-type aware attention models** to unify predictions across domains  
- 🧬 **Spatial transcriptomics analysis of pancreatic tumors** to uncover cell-type interactions and pathway activations  
- 🧾 Contributing to multiple manuscripts and collaborative research on stem cell transplantation and cancer diagnostics

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

**Languages**: Python (primary), R (basic), Markdown, LaTeX  
**Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, scikit-learn, SHAP, TabPFN  
**Bioinformatics**: Seurat, Scanpy, Squidpy, scVelo, Harmony, CellPhoneDB  
**Visualization**: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, ggplot2, Adobe Illustrator  
**Platforms**: GitHub, Google Colab, VSCode, HPC clusters
